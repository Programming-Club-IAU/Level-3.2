### 2. Flutter Basic Widgets

- Go into the `lib` folder and open `main.dart`

#### Looking at the code

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const MainApp());
}

class MainApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MainApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return const MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Hello World!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

- The `main()` function is the entry point of the app. It is where the app starts executing.
- The `runApp()` function takes a widget and runs it. In this case, we are running the `MainApp` widget.
- The `MainApp` widget is a stateless widget. Stateless widgets are immutable, meaning that their properties can't changeâ€”all values are final. This widget does not have to be called `MainApp`, but it is good practice to name your widget the same as your file.
- The `MainApp` widget has a `build()` method that returns a widget. This is the widget that will be displayed when the app is launched.
- The `MainApp` widget returns a `MaterialApp` widget. The `MaterialApp` widget is a widget that provides a framework for implementing the basic material design layout of your app.

#### [MaterialApp](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp-class.html)

```dart
MaterialApp(
    title: 'Weather App',
    theme: ThemeData(

    ),
    home: const Scaffold(),
    debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
);
```

- The `MaterialApp` widget is the root widget of your app. It is what allows you to use Material Design components in your app.
- The `MaterialApp` widget has a `home` property that takes a widget. This is the widget that will be displayed when the app is launched.
- The `MaterialApp` widget also has a `theme` property that takes a `ThemeData` object. This is where you can customize the theme of your app.
- The `MaterialApp` widget also has a `title` property that takes a string. This is the title of your app that will be displayed in the app switcher.
- The `MaterialApp` widget also has a `debugShowCheckedModeBanner` property that takes a boolean. This is whether or not you want the debug banner to be displayed in the top right corner of your app.

### 3. Importing Assets

#### Modifying the `pubspec.yaml` file

- Go into the `pubspec.yaml` file
- Under the `flutter` section, you'll see a `assets` section
- Add the following code to the `assets` section:

```yaml
  - assets/images/
```

- This will tell Flutter to look in the `assets/images/` folder for any assets that you want to use in your app
- Save the `pubspec.yaml` file

#### Adding an image

- create a folder called `images` in the `assets` folder
- add an image to the `images` folder

#### AssetImage vs NetworkImage

- There are two ways to add an image to your app
  - `AssetImage`
    - This is used for images that are stored locally in your app
  - `NetworkImage`
    - This is used for images that are stored on the internet

#### [AssetImage](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/painting/AssetImage-class.html)

```dart
Image(
  image: AssetImage('assets/images/image.png'),
);
```

- The `Image` widget is a widget that displays an image.
- The `Image` widget has an `image` property that takes an `ImageProvider` object. This is the image that will be displayed.
- The `AssetImage` widget is a widget that displays an image that is stored locally in your app.

#### [NetworkImage](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/painting/NetworkImage-class.html)

```dart
Image(
  image: NetworkImage('https://picsum.photos/200'),
);
```

- The `NetworkImage` widget is a widget that displays an image that is stored on the internet.
- The `NetworkImage` widget has a `url` property that takes a string. This is the url of the image that will be displayed.
- The `Image` widget is a widget that displays an image.

#### Adding an image to a container

```dart
Container(
  width: 100,
  height: 100,
  decoration: BoxDecoration(
    image: DecorationImage(
      image: AssetImage('assets/images/image.png'),
    ),
  ),
);
```

- The `Container` widget is a widget that allows you to customize the size, color, and child of a widget.
- The `Container` widget has a `decoration` property that takes a `BoxDecoration` object. This is the decoration of the container.
- The `BoxDecoration` widget is a widget that allows you to customize the decoration of a container.
- The `BoxDecoration` widget has an `image` property that takes a `DecorationImage` object. This is the image that will be displayed in the container.

#### 4. Creating a custom widget (example: detailsRow)

- Go into the `lib` folder and create a folder called `widgets`
- Create a file called `details_row.dart` in the `widgets` folder

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class DetailsRow extends StatelessWidget {
  const DetailsRow({
    super.key,
    required this.text,
    required this.icon,
  });

  final String text;
  final Icon icon;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Row(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround,
      children: [
        icon,
        Text(
          text,
          style: const TextStyle(
            color: Colors.black,
            fontSize: 20,
            fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
          ),
        ),
        const SizedBox(),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

- The `DetailsRow` widget is a widget that displays a row of details.
- We have created a custom widget called `DetailsRow` that takes two properties: `text` and `icon`.
- The `text` property is a string that will be displayed in the row.
- The `icon` property is an icon that will be displayed in the row.

#### Using the custom widget

- Go into the `main.dart` file
- Import the `DetailsRow` widget

```dart
import 'widgets/details_row.dart';
```

- Use the `DetailsRow` widget

```dart
DetailsRow(
  text: 'Feels Like 70Â°',
  icon: const Icon(
    Icons.thermostat_outlined,
    color: Colors.black,
  ),
),
```

### 5. Creating a screen

- Go into the `lib` folder and create a folder called `screens`
- Create a file called `home_screen.dart` in the `screens` folder

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  const HomeScreen({
    super.key,
  });

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text('Weather App'),
      ),
      body: const Center(
        child: Text('Hello World!'),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {},
        child: const Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

- The `HomeScreen` page is a widget that displays the home screen of the app.
- We have created a custom page called `HomeScreen`.
- The `HomeScreen` page is a stateless widget. Stateless widgets are immutable, meaning that their properties can't changeâ€”all values are final. This widget does not have to be called `HomeScreen`, but it is good practice to name your widget the same as your file.

#### Using the screen

- Go into the `main.dart` file
- Import the `HomeScreen` page

```dart
import 'screens/home_screen.dart';
```

- Use the `HomeScreen` page

```dart
MaterialApp(
  title: 'Weather App',
  theme: ThemeData(
    primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
  ),
  home: const HomeScreen(),
  debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
);
```
